Forest Canopy Change 
***************************************************

Forest Canopy Changes were generated using two routes.

    - Changes based on the Reference year i.e 2016 (Reference Product).
    - Changes based on the difference between the consquent year (Annual Product)

Reference Product
============================
Reference Products are achieved after computing the difference between the compasrison year\base year (2016),
and the other consequent years i.e 2017, 2018, 2019 & 2020. This product detects the deforestation that occurs in comparison
to the baseline year which is 2016. The output and statistics assumes the forest zones are instant forest, and the changes
are be used for REDD+ reporting, as they are.
The forest canopy classes in consideration for computation are the Forest and Non Forest classes, whereby the Forest Canopies are considered as Forest Areas, while the 
Non Forest remain as they are.
Classifying the forest canopy densities this way makes it possible to monitor forest degradation every year, in each forest of interest with the loss class.

Annual Product
============================
The changes are computed in comparison to the consequent years. To monitor the forest regrowth between two years, this product is applied.
The changes are generated after computing change between the forest canopy densitied from 2016 - 2020
The products available are 2016 - 2017, 2017 - 2018, 2018 - 2019 & 2019 - 2020, and the updating of newer products will be done at the end of the year.

The figure below shows the summary logic of computing the forest changes is as as shown below.
