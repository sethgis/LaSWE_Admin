Forest Change 
***************************************************
Forest change or canopy disturbance mapping was based on analysing the canopy changes between a reference year and an analysis year to map out areas that are deforested, stable or as regrown (gain areas).
This method ensured a clear identification of disturbed areas within the analysis year with reference to the base year. The output visualised changes that occurred between the consequent years. The figure below summarises the steps in analysing forest change\canopy disturbed areas.


The figure below shows the summary logic of computing the forest changes/canopy disturbance.
