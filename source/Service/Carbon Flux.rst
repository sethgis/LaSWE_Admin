***************************************************
Computing Carbon Flux
***************************************************
The canopy disturbance/forest change are generated from the simple image difference acquired from the comparison of 
the Forest Canopy Density products of 2016 as baseline year, and subsequent years (2017, 2018, 2019, 2020).

To compute the Carbon flux product in TroFMIS, like in other forest products, a user will need to select the carbon flux procuct from the drop down list.
