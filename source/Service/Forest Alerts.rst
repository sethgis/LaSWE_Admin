Forest Degradation is a systematic process where the forest losses its capacity of providing the goods and services, 
due to continuous extraction of trees and disruption of the forest ecosystem, ultimately leading to deforestation. 
Degradation can also be attributed to continuous loss of forest quality of vegetation over time.
Forest degradation can be monitored using both optical and radar sensors. 


However, radar is a preferred choice because of its cloud penetration characteristics and high sensitivity to forest 
canopy changes which are key in illustrating degradation. In Radar images, forest degradation 
is detected using bivariate change detection on dual-polarization Radar images ie. VV & VH.
