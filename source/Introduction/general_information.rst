General Information
=====================
TroFMIS is a surveilance system that is based on monitoring the Tropical Montane Forest in the IGAD region. The Tropical montane forest monitoring is part
of the global goal towards reduction of carbon emission, while enhancing verifiable modes for REDD+ reporting. 
TroFMIS is keen on applying REDD+ monitoring guidelines outlined by UNCCD on tropical forest and carbon emission reporting. Thus, the system has intergrated these
products.

	- Forest cover status (tree cover density mask for a reference year 2016) maps
	- Forest canopy changes (annual change 2016-2020) maps
	- Forest canopy changes from Reference year 2016-2020 maps
	- Forest canopy disturbance monitoring using Sentinel 2 -  Radar Images
	
TrofMIS generation/derivation of RADAR Forest Cover Loss Alerts, Tree Cover Density, Forest Canopy Disturbance Monitoring products on selected tropical forests for REDD+ reporting once new data is availableTraining materials (user manual) on the developments of the data acquisition, analysis and generation of final products.
	
The goal is to anable the various key players in REDD+ reporting while accounting for the amount of carbon stock emmitted as well as the carbon retained.

Aknowledgement
--------------
Special appreciation to the `ICPAC <https://www.icpac.net/>`_ team for the great support in validation of the outputs as well as 
contribution to refine the methodologies. 
Appreciation to the countries patners who were part of the great work in providing feedback on the products generated.
The `JRC <https://www.icpac.net/>`_ team provided good reference in developing the forest products for visualisation as well as a
