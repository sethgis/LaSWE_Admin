General Information
=====================

TroFMIS is a surveilance system that monitors Tropical Montane Forest in the Eastern Africa region. The tropical montane forests conservation is part
of the sustainable development goal towards reduction of carbon emission, through development of verifiable methods for REDD+ monitoring and reporting. 
TroFMIS is keen on applying REDD+ monitoring guidelines outlined by various stakeholders such as UNCCD, UNFCC & FAO on tropical forest and carbon emission reporting.
The products developed in TroFMIS that supports the tropical forest monitoring and surveilance activities include:

	(i)  Forest Canopy Density (FCD)
	(ii) Forest Canopy Changes (FCC)
	(iii) Forest Disturbance Monitoring - Radar 
	(iv) Forest Alerts - Radar
	
The products in TroFMIS enables key stakeholders and end users in monitoring the continous 
vegetation change within their forests of interest, in addition to near real time monitoring of the 
forest disturbance. The various users, will also receive periodical alerts pertaining to the
disturbance of the forest canopy densties within their forests of interests.
