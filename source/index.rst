The IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC) under their Global Monitoring for Environment 
and Security & Africa (GMES & Africa) Support Programme, intended to implement Earth Observation 
System for Tropical Forest Surveillance, Monitoring and Assessment (TFSMA) Service. 
The applicationâ€™s main aim was to use Earth Observation methods/algorithms and tools to generate geospatial 
data products for tropical forest monitoring. The intension of these products, was to necessitite REDD+ monitoring 
in response to African needs in water, natural resources, marine, coastal areas and moreso carbon flux monitoring.
The system and products align with the global goal to manage the environment, mitigate climate change and ensure civil security.
