The IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC), under the Global Monitoring for Environment 
and Security & Africa (GMES & Africa) project, implemented Earth Observation based 
System for Tropical Forest Surveillance, Monitoring and Assessment (TFSMA) Service. 
The applicationâ€™s main aim is to use Earth Observation methods/algorithms and tools to generate geospatial 
data products for tropical forest monitoring. 

The overall TroFMIS goal aligns with GMES & Africa thematic chapters identified and agreed on for the Action Plan, which includes:

* Long term Management of Natural Resources; 
* Water Resource Management; 
* Marine & Coastal Areas Management; 
* Food Security and Rural Development; 
* Climate Variability and Change; 
* Disaster Risk Reduction; 
* Health; 
* Conflict and Political Crisis, and 
* Infrastructure and Territorial Development.


Thus, TroFMIS implementation ensures an evidenced based information, that will support the end users and stakeholders towards 
monitoring and assess forest activities, in order to achieve sustainable natural resources management and use.
